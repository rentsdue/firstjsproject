        <div id="tribute-info">
            <p>Hideki Tojo was a Japanese politician and general of the Imperial Japanese Army who served as Prime Minister of Japan and President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association for most of World War II. Tojo was born on December 30, 1884, in Tokyo, Japan, into a family with a distinguished military background. Rising through the ranks, he became known for his staunch support of Japan's expansionist policies.</p>
            <p>As Prime Minister from October 17, 1941, to July 22, 1944, Tojo was a key architect of Japan's military strategy and wartime policies. He was responsible for ordering the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which initiated war between Japan and the United States and led to the Pacific War. Under his leadership, Japan pursued aggressive military campaigns across Southeast Asia and the Pacific, aiming to establish a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
            <p>Tojo's government also enforced strict wartime measures at home, including rationing, censorship, and conscription, while promoting ultranationalist and militarist ideologies. However, as Japan's fortunes in the war declined, Tojo faced increasing opposition and was forced to resign in 1944 following the loss of Saipan, a critical defeat that brought American bombers within striking distance of the Japanese home islands.</p>
            <p>After Japan's surrender in 1945, Tojo was arrested by the Allied forces. He attempted suicide but survived and was subsequently tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. He was found guilty of war crimes, including waging wars of aggression and crimes against humanity, largely due to the atrocities committed by Japanese forces under his leadership. Tojo was sentenced to death and executed by hanging on December 23, 1948.</p>
            <p>Despite his role in the war, Tojo has remained a controversial figure in Japan and abroad, symbolizing the complexities and tragedies of Japan's wartime actions and their lasting impact on international relations.</p>
