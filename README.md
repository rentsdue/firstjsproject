**0. Pyramid Generator**

This section of code (pyramid.js) generates a pyramid on the command line using various coding elements such as for loops, while loops, and functions. It's a rather minor portion of the entire project so I decided to give it "number 0" like how arrays in programming assign the first element in a array to the number 0. It's quite appropriate in this context.
